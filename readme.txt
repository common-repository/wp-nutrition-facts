Insert a Nutrition Facts Table to pages, posts and custom post type.

== Description ==

Canada's nutrition labelling regulations have been designed to provide a system for conveying information about the nutrient content of food in a standardized format, which allows for comparison among foods at the point of purchase. Clear, uniform information should support consumers in making informed food choices toward healthy eating goals.

Canadians need nutrition information to permit dietary management of chronic diseases of public health significance, and to help them make food choices that may reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.

This plugin uses the **[CFIA](http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/nutrite.shtml)** Nutrition Labelling Regulations. For more information please visit **[www.inspection.gc.ca](http://www.inspection.gc.ca)** or your can visit **[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition_facts_label](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition_facts_label)**
